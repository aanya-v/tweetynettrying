# Set up virtual environment
---
in your terminal, use this to create a new virtual environment with the necessary dependencies 
```{bash}
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

If you already have a virtual environment and want to update it you can instead
```{bash}
conda env update -f environment.yml
```
